# CyberSec Handler Journal

Welcome to my CyberSec Handler Journal! This repository serves as a log documenting the experiences of a cybersecurity incident handler (MOCK). 
Here, I created entries detailing incidents encountered, analyses of packet captures, investigations of file hashes, and reflections on 
learning experiences in incident detection and response.

## Contents

- **Entries:** Each entry provides a snapshot of a specific incident or learning activity, including descriptions, tools used, key takeaways, and reflections.
- **Reflections/Notes:** Additional insights and reflections on challenging activities, changes in understanding, and favorite tools or concepts.
